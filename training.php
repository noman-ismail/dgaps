              <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
              <h3>Object-Oriented Programming – OOP using C++ Training</h3>
              <p><strong>Digital Applications</strong> proudly announces the commencement of <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C-plus plus </strong>training course in Khanewal. Learn from introductory to advanced level C++ and sharpen you programming skills. Our team of expert trainers will train the best practices and techniques, which will able you to professionally develop portable, efficient and maintainable applications.</p>
              <h3>What is Object-Oriented Programming C++?</h3>
              <p>OOP stands for “Object Oriented Programming”. It refers to ‘objects’ based method of programming, instead of just procedures and functions. These ‘objects’ are categorized into ‘classes’. In ‘Classes’ individual objects are grouped together. Almost all modern programming languages like C/C++, Java and PHP are Object-Oriented. In addition, many older programming languages have object-oriented versions.</p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h3>Why should you learn C++?</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>C++ has approved as the best language to learn fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming.</li>
                <li>All concepts of Object-Oriented Programming are applied elaborately in C++ whereas advanced languages use shortcuts.</li>
                <li>It is almost impossible to learn the concepts of OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) by reading theory only. If you apply OOPs in practical programs, only then you will be able to grasp the whole concept of OOPs.</li>
                <li>Once you have learned C++, learning other technologies or languages will become much easier.</li>
                <li>Once you are done with C++, you will never look back as working in other languages and technologies will become a cakewalk for you. All the modern languages and programming are based upon Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs).</li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h3>Applications of C++ Language:</h3>
              <p>Software written in C or C++ is at the heart of almost every IT platform and information system worldwide.&nbsp; Objective C is the standard language for programming the Apple iOS mobile platform, while both C and C++ continue to be in demand as essential skills for programmers of system-level code. These are the areas where C++ is applied or can be applied:</p>

              </ul>
              <p></p>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h4>1.&nbsp; &nbsp;Games:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>C++ Optimizes resource management.</li>
                <li>C++ programming language is ideal for multiplayer networked games.</li>
                <li>C++ is extremely fast, therefore provides greater control over hardware. Greater control over hardware is necessity to develop the gaming software.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h4>2.&nbsp; &nbsp;Graphical User-Interface (GUI) based applications:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Famous GUI based applications i.e. Adobe Premiere, Image Reader, Illustrator and Photoshop are largely developed using C++.</li>
                <li>Famous GUI frameworks i.e. WinAPI, Qt, wxWidgets, JUCE, CEGUI, CEF are all programmed in C++.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h4>3.&nbsp; &nbsp;Web Browsers:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>Moreover, famous browsers Mozilla Firefox and Thunderbird IE are also built on C++ largely.</li>
                <li>Many rendering engines like Google have used C++ to build their web browsers (Chrome) for fast speed.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h4>4.&nbsp; &nbsp;Operating Systems:</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>At the time of developing iOS, Apple developers have used Objective C, which is almost equal to C++. Because Objective C is not a procedural language, it is Object-Oriented Programming language like C++.</li>
                <li>Furthermore, Operating System called Symbian, which is used on Mobile Phones, has also developed using C++ to some extent.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>&nbsp;</p>
              <h4>5.&nbsp; &nbsp;DBMS and RDBMS</h4>
              <ul>
                <li>DBMS (Data Base Management System) and RDBMS (Relational Data Base Management System) are excellent suites to create and manage large databases i.e. MySql is one of the most popular open source DBMS in the world. MySql has been developed using C++.&nbsp;</li>
                <li>SQLite is easiest and much portable data base management application. SQLite is written in C plus plus.</li>
              </ul>
